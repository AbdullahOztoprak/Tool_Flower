## Notes

- SSH: Add your public key to the remote server for SSH features.

## How to Generate and Use SSH Keys (Short Version)

1. Open a terminal (or PowerShell on Windows).
2. Run:
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   (Just press Enter for the default location. Set a passphrase if you want.)
3. Your public key is at:
   - `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (Linux/Mac/VM)
   - `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub` (Windows)
4. Open and copy all text from `id_rsa.pub`.
   - On Windows, you can use:
     ```powershell
     notepad id_rsa.pub
     ```
5. Paste your public key into the "Your SSH Public Key" field above.
6. On your VM/server, run:
   ```sh
   cd ~/.ssh/
   nano authorized_keys
   ```
   (Paste your PC's public key here and save. For this, you need to generate a key on your VM too. You can simply type `ssh-keygen` and follow the prompts.)
7. Never share your private key (`id_rsa`). Only share your public key (`id_rsa.pub`).
8. To save and exit nano: Ctrl+O (write), Enter (confirm), Ctrl+X (exit).
